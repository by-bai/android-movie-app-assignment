### Reflection
29 March 2021 | This assignment has exposed me to the industry standards and best practices for Android programming. The learning curve for RxJava was steep for me while coping with school assignments and because of that, I did not have enough time to write code for Dependency Injection and Unit Tests which I had no prior experience in. There are lots of room for improvement in my current code as well -- I will definitely revisit this piece of assignment when time allows and deepen my learning in concepts I am not familiar with, such as Reactive Programming, Dependency Injection and writing effective tests. Overall, I am thankful for this learning opportunity and I certainly had fun learning.
